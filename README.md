# Description
This is a node.js command-line application that prompts a user for input regarding a hypothetical engineering team. It will generate a dynamic HTML page based on user input regarding team members and their roles and various information. 
# Installation
To run this application, you must install inquirer (8.2.4), node, path, and fs. 
# Usage
When you run node index.js in your VS code, you will be prompted with a series of questions in your command line. You will have the opportunity to assign a manager along with any engineers or interns. When you finish assigning team members, a dynamic HTML page will be generated with the team information.

To view a demonstration of using the app, see video included in repo.
